## Data Notes
1. For my questions, I used Search Terms.  Originally, I used the Topics, but they didn't offer anything interesting. The downloaded data had all the terms in english.
2. I manipulated the csv files so they were all in one document per country. The downloaded data didn't have the country or dates searched.  Instead of spending a lot of time in python updating them, I added the month into the csv.  I used python/pandas to add the country and put all the data into one dataframe.
