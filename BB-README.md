## Data Notes
1. For my questions, I used Search Topics.  This ensures that all of the results are in english
2. I manipulated the csv files so they were all in one document per country.  The downloaded data didn't have the country or dates searched.  Instead of spending a lot of time in python updating them, I did it part way and completed it in the notebook
